<h5 class="h5-xl">Introduction</h5>
<p class="p-lg">These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the internet website owned and operated by Appilix, and located at appilix.com and *.appilix.com (the “Site”) including all subsidiary webpages and access to any optimized version of the Site via a wireless device, and access and use of the services available thereon, including, without limitation, the services that enable you to create, test and host promotion-specific custom landing pages for online marketing purposes (the “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you, the person using this Site, and Appilix. Terms such as “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Appilix.</p>
<p class="p-lg">YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSENT TO APPILIX’S PRIVACY POLICY LOCATED AT <a target="_blank" href="privacy-policy.html" class="skyblue-color">https://appilix.com/privacy-policy</a> (THE “PRIVACY POLICY”), BY DOING ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: (1) VISITING THIS SITE; (2) MAKING A PURCHASE OR SUBMITTING CONTENT THROUGH THE SITE; (3) COMPLETING THE ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESS BY CLICKING A BOX INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE; OR (4) BY EXECUTING A SUBSCRIPTION THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT. </p>
<p class="p-lg">If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the services.</p>

<div class="terms-box">
<h5 class="h5-xl">Fees</h5>
<p class="p-lg">You shall pay all fees specified in any subscription to Services or use of the Site (“Subscription”).

Such fees shall be billed in advance for each period and are non-refundable except as specifically mentioned in these Terms of Service. Except for refunds provided for cancellation of Subscriptions within the first fifteen (15) days (as described in the section below entitled Cancellation and Termination and in the Appilix Refund Policy), there will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service or for periods in which your Subscription remains active but you do not use the Services.</p>

<p class="p-lg">All prices listed, fees, charges and refunds are issued in USD. We make no guarantees as to the exchange rate between any currencies, or that the exchange rate will remain unchanged during any period of time. The cost of Services may increase or decrease over a given period of time depending on the currency you choose to pay with and the specific exchange rate at that time. Refunds are likewise issued in USD and are subject to exchange rate volatility. There will be no additional refunds or credits issued in consideration of current or eventual exchange rates. You are responsible for any currency exchange taxes, fees, or other costs that may incur by making a purchase of our Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="terms-box">
<h5 class="h5-xl">Refunds</h5>
